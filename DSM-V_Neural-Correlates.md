The DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition) outlines a range of mental health conditions, and each is associated with distinct brain structures. Here's a summary of key brain regions affected by major categories of DSM-5 diagnoses:

### 1. **Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders**
   - **Prefrontal Cortex**: Dysfunction in this area leads to impaired executive functions, decision-making, and cognitive control.
   - **Hippocampus**: Involved in memory formation, the hippocampus is often smaller in people with schizophrenia.
   - **Ventricles**: Enlarged ventricles in the brain are common, indicating a loss of brain tissue.
   - **Basal Ganglia**: Involved in movement and coordination, often overactive in schizophrenia, contributing to symptoms like paranoia.
   - **Thalamus**: Affects sensory processing and information relay.

### 2. **Bipolar and Related Disorders**
   - **Amygdala**: Responsible for emotion regulation, individuals with bipolar disorder often show increased activity here during manic episodes.
   - **Prefrontal Cortex**: Reduced activity here is associated with poor emotional regulation, decision-making, and impulse control during depressive episodes.
   - **Hippocampus**: Can show reduced volume, affecting memory and stress regulation.
   - **Anterior Cingulate Cortex**: Involved in mood regulation and decision-making.

### 3. **Depressive Disorders**
   - **Prefrontal Cortex**: Lower activity, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, relates to impaired decision-making and emotional regulation.
   - **Amygdala**: Heightened activity, leading to increased negative emotional responses like sadness and fear.
   - **Hippocampus**: Reduced volume, often linked to chronic stress and impaired memory.
   - **Anterior Cingulate Cortex**: Decreased activity is associated with difficulties in managing emotional responses.

### 4. **Anxiety Disorders**
   - **Amygdala**: Overactivity here is central to the heightened fear response seen in anxiety disorders.
   - **Prefrontal Cortex**: Reduced activity limits cognitive control over fear responses.
   - **Hippocampus**: Involved in memory processing, often smaller in individuals with chronic anxiety, impacting contextual memory and the regulation of fear.
   - **Insular Cortex**: Linked to the perception of bodily states (interoception), often overactive in anxiety disorders, contributing to heightened awareness of physiological responses.

### 5. **Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders**
   - **Orbitofrontal Cortex**: Increased activity is linked to the intrusive thoughts and compulsions characteristic of OCD.
   - **Basal Ganglia**: Overactivity in the striatum (part of the basal ganglia) contributes to repetitive behaviors.
   - **Thalamus**: Hyperactivity here may cause excessive worry and rumination.
   - **Anterior Cingulate Cortex**: Abnormalities in this region are associated with the persistent discomfort and urge to perform compulsive actions.

### 6. **Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders (e.g., PTSD)**
   - **Amygdala**: Hyperactivity is associated with heightened fear responses and emotional reactivity.
   - **Prefrontal Cortex**: Decreased activity affects the ability to regulate emotions and cognitive control over fear.
   - **Hippocampus**: Reduced volume impacts memory consolidation, leading to intrusive memories and flashbacks.
   - **Anterior Cingulate Cortex**: Dysregulation in this region correlates with difficulties in managing emotional and physiological responses to stress.

### 7. **Neurodevelopmental Disorders (e.g., ADHD, Autism)**
   - **Prefrontal Cortex**: Reduced activity in ADHD leads to impairments in attention, impulse control, and executive function.
   - **Basal Ganglia**: Dysregulation here affects motor control and cognitive processes.
   - **Amygdala and Limbic System**: In autism, abnormalities here affect emotional processing and social behavior.
   - **Cerebellum**: In both ADHD and autism, structural differences in the cerebellum are linked to motor coordination and some cognitive processes.

### 8. **Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders**
   - **Prefrontal Cortex**: Impaired decision-making, self-control, and emotional regulation.
   - **Nucleus Accumbens**: Part of the reward pathway, overactivity here reinforces addictive behaviors by increasing the perception of reward.
   - **Amygdala**: Involved in craving and emotional responses to substance cues.
   - **Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA)**: Part of the brain's reward system, crucial for dopamine release, reinforcing addictive behaviors.

### 9. **Eating Disorders**
   - **Insular Cortex**: Plays a role in body perception and self-awareness, often disrupted in anorexia nervosa.
   - **Amygdala**: Increased activity is related to heightened emotional responses, particularly around food and body image.
   - **Prefrontal Cortex**: Involved in impaired self-regulation and decision-making, particularly in relation to food intake and body image.

### 10. **Personality Disorders**
   - **Amygdala**: Dysregulation is common in borderline personality disorder (BPD), leading to intense emotional responses and fear of abandonment.
   - **Prefrontal Cortex**: In BPD and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), impaired activity is linked to poor impulse control and decision-making.
   - **Anterior Cingulate Cortex**: Associated with emotional regulation and social behavior, abnormalities can contribute to the interpersonal difficulties seen in personality disorders.
