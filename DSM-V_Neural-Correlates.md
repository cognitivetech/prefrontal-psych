## Brain Regions and Neurotransmitters

*key brain regions and neurotransmitter's impacted by main categories of DSM-5 diagnoses*

1. **Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders**
   - **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)**: 
     - Dopamine: Hyperactivity in mesocortical pathway
     - Glutamate: NMDA receptor hypofunction

     - Glutamate and GABA: Imbalance affecting sensory processing

2. **Bipolar and Related Disorders**
   - **Amygdala**: 
     - Norepinephrine: Increased during manic episodes
   - **Prefrontal Cortex**: 
     - Serotonin: Decreased activity during depressive episodes
     - Dopamine: Fluctuations between manic (increase) and depressive (decrease) episodes

## Note

1. Accuracy: The information presented generally aligns with current neuroscientific understanding of these disorders. However, brain-behavior relationships are complex, and our understanding is continually evolving.

2. Simplification: This summary necessarily simplifies complex neurobiological processes. In reality, these disorders involve intricate interactions between multiple brain regions and neurotransmitter systems.

3. Variability: There can be significant individual variability in brain structure and function among people with the same diagnosis.

4. Ongoing research: Some of these associations are still areas of active research, and new findings may refine or alter our understanding.

5. Multifactorial nature: Mental health disorders are influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurobiological factors, not just brain structure and neurotransmitter function.

6. Specificity: Some of the neurotransmitter changes listed (e.g., "altered signaling") are quite general and could be more specific in some cases.

7. Citation needed: For use in a professional or academic context, this information would need to be supported by appropriate citations to primary research or review articles.
